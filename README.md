# Xchain Client

Xchain Client provides a set of tools to facilitate cross-chain data movement from Filecoin storage to any blockchain. It includes utilities for managing Ethereum accounts, submitting offers, and handling deal status.

---

## üöÄ Installation

Ensure you have **Go** installed. Then, clone the repository and build the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/xchainClient.git
cd xchainClient
go build -o xchainClient
```
---

## üìå Configure Environment Variables
1. Create a `.env` file to store your **XCHAIN_PASSPHRASE** (used for unlocking the Ethereum keystore):
    ```sh
    echo "export XCHAIN_PASSPHRASE=your_secure_password" > .env
    ```

2. **Source the file** to load the variable into your environment before you run any xchainClient commands:
   ```sh
   source .env
   ```

3. Verify that the variable is set:
   ```sh
   echo $XCHAIN_PASSPHRASE
   ```

## üîë **Generating an Ethereum Account**

A new command, `generate-account`, allows you to create an Ethereum keystore account and store it at a **specific file path**.

```sh
./xchainClient generate-account --keystore-file ./config/xchain_key.json --password "$XCHAIN_PASSPHRASE"

```

### **Example Output**
```
New Ethereum account created!
Address: 0x123456789abcdef...
Keystore File Path: /home/user/onramp-contracts/xchain_key.json
```

üîπ This saves the keystore file **at the exact location specified**. The file is **password-protected** and should be stored securely.

üîπ To run xChainClient for a specific chain, you need to request some test token to this wallet address from that chain.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Daemon

Once you have finisehd the above process and sucessfully deployed [onramp contracts](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/onramp-contracts) to the source chain and Filecoin. You should update the `config.json` with the correct information.

To start the Xchain adapter daemon, run:

```sh
./xchainClient daemon --config ./config/config.json --chain avalanche --buffer-service --aggregation-service
```

---

## üì° **offering data with automatic car processing**

the `offer-file` command simplifies offering data by automatically:

1. converting the file into a car format.
2. calculating the commp (content identifier for proofs).
3. uploading the car file to a local buffer service.
4. submitting an offer transaction to the blockchain.

```sh
./xchainclient client offer-file --chain avalanche --config ./config/config.json <file_path> <payment-addr> <payment-amount>
```

example:

```sh
./xchainclient client offer-file --chain avalanche ./data/sample.txt 0x5c31e78f3f7329769734f5ff1ac7e22c243e817e 1000
```

---

## üì° **submitting an offer (manual method)**

to submit an offer to the onramp contract manually:

```sh
./xchainclient client offer <commp> <size> <cid> <bufferlocation> <token-hex> <token-amount>
```

example:

```sh
./xchainclient client offer bafkreihdwdcef4n... 128 /data/file1 /buffers/ 0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f 1000
```

---

## üîç **Checking Deal Status**

To check the deal status for a CID:

```sh
./xchainClient client dealStatus <cid> <offerId>
```

Example:
```sh
./xchainClient client dealStatus bafkreihdwdcef4n 42
```

---

## üìñ **Additional Notes**
- **Keep your `config.json` file secure** since it contains sensitive information like private key paths and authentication tokens.
- **Use strong passwords** when generating Ethereum accounts.
- **Regularly back up keystore files** to avoid losing access to funds.

---

## üí° **Troubleshooting**
### Error: "config.json not found"
Ensure the config file is correctly placed in the `config/` directory and named `config.json`.

### Error: "invalid keystore file"
Ensure the keystore file is correctly generated using `generate-account` and that you are using the correct password.

### Error: "failed to connect to API"
Check that your `Api` field in `config.json` is correctly set to a working Ethereum/Web3 provider.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### **Config File (`config.json`)**

The Xchain Client uses a `config.json` file to store its settings. The configuration file should be placed inside the `config/` directory.

#### **Example `config.json`**
```json
{
  "destination": {
    "ChainID": 314159,
    "LotusAPI": "https://api.calibration.node.glif.io",
    "ProverAddr": "0x61F0ACE5ad40466Eb43141fa56Cf87758b6ffbA8"
  },

  "BufferPort": 5077,
  "ProviderAddr": "t0116147",

### **Multi-Chain Support**
Xchain Client supports interaction with multiple blockchains. Users can configure multiple `sources` to enable cross-chain deal submissions. Supported networks include:
- **Filecoin**
- **Avalanche**
- **Polygon**

Each source requires an **API endpoint** and an **OnRamp contract address**, which are specified under the `sources` field in `config.json`.
